# Glasslabs Yocto Runner image recipe
Docker Image recipe for generating a self-hosted Github organization runner capable of building a Yocto Linux rootfs

sudo docker build -t akarnil/iotc-python:latest .
docker push akarnil/iotc-python:latest


### Using this Docker image
This image can be retrived from Docker hub and used to create a new container.
```console
sudo docker pull akarnil/iotc-python:latest
```

The yocto-runner image utilizes a GitHub PAT to request a runner token from Github. A PAT can be generated by going to ```Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens``` on Github. The token needs to have ```repo```, ```workflow``` and ```admin:org``` access rights. Record the token and keep it in a safe place.

Once you have your token, we can spool up our container using the newly retrieved docker image. You can set the ```name``` to whatever you'd like to call your container.
```console
sudo docker run -d --env ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR-GITHUB-ACCESS-TOKEN> --name runner akarnil/iotc-python
```

You can verify the status of the runner by executing the following.
```console
sudo docker logs runner -f
```

You should see something similar to the output below:
```console
